SpongeMatchers
==============

SpongeMatchers makes developing plugins easier by providing you ways to parse and use matchers.
Matchers are objects that can check if an object meets some specific requirements, for example, the integer matcher *>2* matches all integers that are greater than *2*.
Using simple matchers like integer matchers as building blocks, it is possible to create more advanced matchers, like item stack matchers or entity matchers.

The `SpongeMatchers documentation <http://docs.monospark.org/spongematchers/>`_ contains all information you need to successfully use SpongeMatchers in your plugin.
